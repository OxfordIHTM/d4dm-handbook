	abstract = {A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              This study aims to identify and outline the critical challenges affecting the inclination of executives to use data as the basis for making decisions at a local government level.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The study conducted in-depth interviews with 21 public officials comprising middle- and top-level executives from 18 agencies and offices at the Bojonegoro Regency, one of Indonesia’s most progressive regencies in pursuing open government and smart cities.
            
            
              Findings
              The findings demonstrate that ensuring a good quality data architecture, nurturing data culture and developing analytics capability are essential in the case of a developing country such as Indonesia. However, insufficient policies and regulations, a nonexistent evaluative framework for data quality, disruptive local tradition and the ingrained autocratic administration represent significant and unique challenges to implementing data-driven decision-making in the local government in Indonesia.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              The chosen research approach may result in a need for more generalizability beyond Indonesia, accentuating the necessity for the geographical objects to include other developing countries in future research.
            
            
              Practical implications
              The findings showcase that lack of awareness and acceptance from public officials and the general public of the importance of a data-driven approach; as such, a better understanding of the change in attitudes and mindsets of public officials is invariably one of the critical practical determinants.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The findings signify the importance of creating robust accountability systems and evaluative frameworks that consider the many variables influencing decisions that capture the significance of organizational and local culture.},

	abstract = {Digital transformation is increasingly becoming a focal point for organizations and governments worldwide, including Kenya. In Kenya, the 2010 Constitution introduced devolution, decentralizing governance, enabling county-level implementation of government programs, and extending governance to the grassroots. Among the functions devolved to counties is Early Childhood Development and Education (Pre-primary education), aimed at enhancing efficiency, transparency, and accountability in governance. Turkana County, inhabited primarily by the Turkana people with a history of nomadic pastoralism, views Pre-primary education as crucial for initiating academic life. Embracing digital transformation in Pre-primary education implementation represents a significant shift. The study focused on Turkana County Government’s strategies for digital transformation in Pre-primary education and identified key objectives: Assessing digital inclusion in public administration in Turkana County; recommending practical implementation of two systems: Turkana Early Childhood Development Education Management Information System and Continuous Database Updating system; and establishing sustainability measures for data-driven decision-making. The study employed a descriptive research design involving observation and desktop review of county online platforms and libraries. Information gathered affirmed the status of digital transformation in Pre-primary education and guided recommendations. Turkana County Government has implemented two digital systems: Turkana Early Childhood Development and Education Management Information System (a website) and Continuous Database Updating System (Data entry and updating system). The website hosts programs and data related to pre-primary education management, including teacher and learner information, infrastructure development, feeding programs, policy updates, and reports on supervision and evaluation of teachers. Recommendations for successful digital transformation included investing in community engagement for program sustainability, strengthening administrative structures, and enhancing digital technology in Pre-primary education. These measures aim to ensure efficient and effective management of Pre-primary education programs. In conclusion, the Turkana County Government’s adoption of the two digital systems marks a significant step towards modernizing Pre-primary education management. By following the study’s recommendations, Turkana County can achieve enhanced governance and educational outcomes through digital transformation, thereby serving as a model for similar initiatives across Kenya’s counties.},
