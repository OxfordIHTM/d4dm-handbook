    "section": "",
    "text": "Preface\nIn today’s data-driven world, the responsibility of public service demands more than experience and intuition; it requires evidence-based decision-making grounded in a deep understanding of data. For government officials at all levels, from local administrators to national policymakers, data is not just a tool - it is an indispensable asset in crafting policies that are effective, equitable, and accountable. Data for Decision Makers is developed with you in mind: to support those entrusted with public leadership in leveraging data to serve communities more effectively.\nAcross the domains of public health, education, transportation, environmental policy, and beyond, the availability of data has never been greater. But with this abundance comes complexity. Making sense of it - identifying relevant patterns, understanding root causes, evaluating outcomes, and anticipating future trends - requires more than access. It demands a strong foundation in the principles and practices of modern data use.\nThis course highlights how data literacy empowers government officials to navigate uncertainty, combat misinformation, and design policies that truly respond to the needs of the public. From statistical reasoning and geographic information systems to predictive modelling and real-time dashboards, the tools of data are transforming governance. Understanding these tools is essential to strengthening transparency, accountability, and public trust.\nThis course bridges the gap between technical expertise and policy leadership. It offers clear, accessible explanations of core data concepts alongside practical examples from the public sector. Whether your role involves strategic planning, budget allocation, programme evaluation, or legislative development, this course will help you make more informed, timely, and impactful decisions.\nPublic service is a profound responsibility. By embracing the potential of data, government leaders can enhance their ability to meet that responsibility with clarity, foresight, and integrity.",

    "text": "1.1 Data-driven decision-making\nIn an era defined by information, the ability to make sound decisions increasingly hinges on the intelligent use of data. Across sectors and industries, from healthcare and education to finance and public policy, decision-makers are confronted with unprecedented volumes of information. Yet, it is not the sheer quantity of data that holds value, but our capacity to interpret, understand, and apply it effectively.\nData is more than numbers on a spreadsheet; it is the language of modern insight. When approached with the right tools and understanding, it becomes a powerful asset for identifying patterns, predicting outcomes, evaluating strategies, and ultimately, improving results. For decision-makers, this means developing fluency not just in reading reports, but in questioning assumptions, validating sources, and interpreting results within context.\nUnderstanding modern data concepts - from statistical reasoning and data visualisation to machine learning and real-time analytics - is no longer optional. It is foundational. These concepts empower leaders to move beyond intuition and anecdote, and toward evidence-based action. As data continues to shape the world around us, the ability to engage with it critically and creatively is becoming an essential skill.\nThis course aims to equip its participants with both the conceptual grounding and practical knowledge to navigate this landscape. Whether you are a seasoned executive, a policy analyst, or an emerging leader, this course is designed to bridge the gap between data science and decision-making. It demystifies the tools and techniques of modern data analysis and offers real-world applications that demonstrate how data can drive progress and innovation.\nGood decisions are not just supported by data; they are shaped by those who know how to use it wisely.\nData-driven decision-making or DDDM refers to the process of making decisions based on data and information rather than intuition or experience alone. It involves collecting, analysing, interpreting, and presenting data to support decision-making processes1–3.\nIn this approach, decisions are made by relying on facts, figures, trends patterns, and insights derived from data. The goal is to make objective, evidence-based decisions that are more accurate, consistent, and transparent.\nData-driven decision-making often involves the use of tools, techniques, and technologies such as data analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and visualisation software. By leveraging these tools, organisations can transform raw data into actionable insights that drive better outcomes.\nIn today’s organisations, this approach has become increasingly important as it allows for more objective and accurate decision-making. The process typically includes identifying relevant data sources, applying analytical techniques, and leveraging technologies like machine learning, artificial intelligence, and visualisation tools to transform raw data to actionable insights that drive better outcomes.\nAn organisation that is data-driven also benefits in being able to spot opportunities and threats early. By analysing data regularly, organisations can anticipate changes and act before problems arise.\nSaving costs is another advantage. In a survey of executives of Fortune 1000 companies regarding their data investments since 2012 commissioned by the Harvard Business Review, nearly half (48.4%) of respondents report that they are documenting measurable results from their investments in big data and 80.7% of the executives describing their investments in big data as being successful1,4.",

    "text": "1.2 About this course\nIn this course, we will explore everything from the basics such as what data is and why it matters to more advanced topics like data collection, storage, analysis, and visualisation. Through practical examples and real-world applications, you’ll learn how to harness the power of data to drive insights, solve problems, and make informed decisions in fields ranging from business and technology to healthcare and beyond. By the end of this course, you’ll not only understand the importance of data but also be prepared to apply these concepts in your own work.\n\n1.2.1 Objectives\nAll these towards the overall objective of making a case for shifting to more data-driven decision-making processes.\nSpecifically, by the end of the course, participants are expected to be able to:\n\nArticulate the value of data driven decision making and programming;\nCritically assess a data by it source, format, structure, types, and classes;\nCritically evaluate the state of their own dataset based on stated best practices;\nOutline the strengths and weaknesses of various types of data tools;\nDemonstrate capacity to use spreadsheet software to clean, process, and structure data; and,\nDemonstrate capacity to use spreadsheet software to perform data analysis.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Case studies\nTo achieve these objectives, the course employs the case-study method, an approach that involves in-depth examination of a specific individual, group, organisation, or event to understand a complex issue in its real-life context.\nFor this course, the five case studies (one for each of the next five chapters) provide a more nuanced narrative of opportunities and challenges of adopting a data-driven approach to decision-making specifically in the context of governance within governments (rather than just in businesses).\n\n\n1.2.3 The who, what, when, where, how, and why framework\nWhen going through these five case studies, it is recommended to first go through them using the who, what, when, where, how, and why framework as a way to get a firm grounding on the case study details.\nThe “who, what, when, where, how, and why” framework is a systematic approach to understanding and analysing data. Another term that can be used for this framework is descriptive metadata which is data that provides information about other data, but not the content itself. So, if I have an image, the metadata wouldn’t be the actual picture, but the details about who took it, when, or where.\nHere’s a structured explanation of each component within this framework:\n\nWho\nRefers to the individuals or entities involved with the data. This includes stakeholders, users, customers, employees, or business partners who interact with or are affected by the data. More specifically, this may include, among others, information on:\n\nwho owns the data;\nwho manages the data;\nwho collects the data;\nwho stores the data; and,\nwho protects/safeguards the data.\n\n\n\nWhat\nDescribes what the data is about and its type, nature, and provenance. It specifies what information is available, such as numerical data, text, images, etc., which helps in understanding the scope and relevance of the data, and how to work with the data.\n\n\nWhen\nPertains to the timing, period, and/or frequency in which the data was/is being collected, recorded, or analysed.\n\n\nWhere\nIndicates the location where the data is stored or accessed. This could be within a database, on a server, or even from external sources like devices or sensors, providing context about data accessibility and storage.\n\n\nHow\nFocuses on the methods used to collect, process, or extract the data. This includes techniques such as surveys, sensor readings, or existing records, which helps in understanding how reliable and comprehensive the data is.\n\n\nWhy\nAsks for the purpose behind collecting and analysing the data. It clarifies why this information is being gathered i.e., whether it’s for reporting, decision-making, monitoring performance, or other objectives. This in turn guides appropriate actions based on the data insights.\n\n\nSummary\nUsing this structured approach helps clarify each aspect of data, ensuring clarity and focus. It is particularly useful for complex datasets and can help address varying questions based on the user’s role, such as an analyst versus a stakeholder.\nIn summary, using the “who, what, when, where, how, and why” framework provides a systematic method to identify key elements of data, ensuring clarity and focus in data management and analysis.\n\n\n\n\n1.

    "text": "2.1 Leadership role\nThis is a case study about the Division of Water (DOW), a local government agency in the State of New York, which has attempted to improve its analytic capabilities by developing efficient data management practices, suggest governance models, and identify analytic techniques potentially beneficial to addressing harmful algal blooms (HABs; see Figure 2.1) and high chloride concentrations1.\nThe DOW faces challenges in using its legacy systems and traditional analytical methods effectively in addressing the problems of HABs and high chloride levels. DOW aims to enhance its decision-making processes through DDDM by improving its ability to gather and analyse data more effectively, beyond their current capabilities, to better inform policy decisions.\nFrom this process, nine key factors across four overarching determinants have been observed and articulated as being crucial to consider by an organisation in implementing a comprehensive strategy for DDDM (see Note 2.1). These factors interrelate and influence each other, requiring a holistic approach to ensure successful adoption.\nThese key determinants are interrelated and interdependent. For example, if an organisation has strong data infrastructure (determinant 1) but lacks the right analytical tools or skilled personnel (determinant 2), their DDDM efforts will be hampered. Similarly, even with good internal structures (determinant 3), if external regulations make it hard to access necessary tools or collaborate externally (determinants 7 and 9), progress is still limited. Without proper stakeholder engagement (determinant 6) and user involvement (determinant 5), the organisation might develop solutions in isolation, leading to less effective decisions. Moreover, privacy constraints (determinant 8) can affect data availability, which in turn impacts analytical capabilities since data is a key input.\nWhile DDDM is often seen as a technical issue involving tools and data, it’s also deeply influenced by organisational and institutional factors. This makes sense because any significant change requires not just new technology but also cultural shifts within the organisation to embrace these changes.\nThese determinants also influence the ability of an organisation to adapt over time. For example, if the organisation faces challenges in public procurement, which is a structural issue, this could create delays that affect the organisation’s overall strategy. Conversely, strong stakeholder engagement might mitigate some of these delays by providing alternative solutions or resources.\nLeadership plays a critical part in driving organisational change. Without supportive leadership, many of these determinants could be obstacles rather than opportunities. For instance, if leaders aren’t committed to DDDM, they might not push for necessary cultural shifts or investment in new tools.",

    "section": "8.3 Principles of data protection",
    "text": "8.3 Principles of data protection\nArticle 5 of the GDPR sets out key principles which lie at the heart of the general data protection regime. These key principles are set out right at the beginning of the GDPR and they both directly and indirectly influence the other rules and obligations found throughout the legislation. Therefore, compliance with these fundamental principles of data protection is the first step for controllers in ensuring that they fulfil their obligations under the GDPR. The following is a brief overview of the Principles of Data Protection found in article 5 GDPR:\n\n8.3.1 Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency\nAny processing of personal data should be lawful and fair. It should be transparent to individuals that personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted, or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be processed. The principle of transparency requires that any information and communication relating to the processing of those personal data be easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and plain language be used.\n\n\n8.3.2 Purpose Limitation\nPersonal data should only be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. In particular, the specific purposes for which personal data are processed should be explicit and legitimate and determined at the time of the collection of the personal data. However, further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific, or historical research purposes or statistical purposes (in accordance with Article 89(1) GDPR) is not considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes.\n\n\n8.3.3 Data Minimisation\nProcessing of personal data must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed. Personal data should be processed only if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably be fulfilled by other means. This requires, in particular, ensuring that the period for which the personal data are stored is limited to a strict minimum (see also the principle of ‘Storage Limitation’ below).\n\n\n8.3.4 Accuracy\nControllers must ensure that personal data are accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; taking every reasonable step to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay. In particular, controllers should accurately record information they collect or receive and the source of that information.\n\n\n8.3.5 Storage Limitation\nPersonal data should only be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed. In order to ensure that the personal data are not kept longer than necessary, time limits should be established by the controller for erasure or for a periodic review.\n\n\n8.3.6 Integrity and Confidentiality\nPersonal data should be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful access to or use of personal data and the equipment used for the processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.\n\n\n8.3.7 Accountability\nFinally, the controller is responsible for, and must be able to demonstrate, their compliance with all of the above-named Principles of Data Protection. Controllers must take responsibility for their processing of personal data and how they comply with the GDPR, and be able to demonstrate (through appropriate records and measures) their compliance.",

File and database encryption software serve as a final line of defense for sensitive volumes by obscuring their contents through encryption or tokenization. Most encryption tools also include security key management capabilities.\n\n\n8.4.2 Data erasure\nData erasure uses software to completely overwrite data on any storage device, making it more secure than standard data wiping. It verifies that the data is unrecoverable.\n\n\n8.4.3 Data masking\nBy masking data, organizations can allow teams to develop applications or train people that use real data. It masks personally identifiable information (PII) where necessary so that development can occur in environments that are compliant.\n\n\n8.4.4 Data resiliency\nResiliency depends on how well an organization endures or recovers from any type of failure—from hardware problems to power shortages and other events that affect data availability. Speed of recovery is critical to minimize impact.",

The various steps in the data pathway (see Figure 9.1) often require specific tools that are best-suited for the task at hand.\nIn this section, we present the most common data tools, describe their key functionalities, and discuss what each tool is best suited for in relation to the steps in the data pathway.\nMicrosoft Excel is versatile spreadsheet software with robust formula capabilities, pivot tables for quick data summarisation, and Power Query for advanced data cleaning. Other than for data collection, it is also suited for detailed analysis, budgeting, and financial tracking. Suitable for complex data management. On the other hand, some may find that using it presents a steeper learning curve and costs of the subscription-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) model as part of Microsoft 365 can be prohibitive.\nAn estimated 750 million up to 1.5 billion people1 use Microsoft Excel. It has numerous applications, including data entry, analysis, accounting, financial modelling, and reporting. It’s used in various fields like business, education, and personal finance to organise, manage, and visualise data.\nOther than Microsoft Excel, there are Excel-like applications available as part of a suite of office applications that use the Open Document Form (ODF), an open file format for word processing documents, spreadsheets, presentations and graphics and using ZIP-compressed XML files. It was developed with the aim of providing an open, XML-based file format specification for office applications. ODF was based on the Sun Microsystems specification for OpenOffice.org XML, the default format for OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice. This standard was originally developed to provide an open standard for office documents. Versions of Microsoft Excel since 2003 use the ODF XML standard to afford compatibility to other spreadsheets that use the standard. A number of free and proprietary software use the ODF XML standard hence there are various Excel-like spreadsheet alternatives available that use the standard2 and are mostly compatible with Microsoft Office/Microsoft 365 applications including Excel. Although generally compatible in almost all of the basic features, Excel-like spreadsheet applications may not fully implement highly customised Excel spreadsheets that use Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros as there are significant differences in syntax and implementation to LibreOffice Calc’s Basic macro system and environment.",

It’s part of the Google Workspace suite, along with Google Docs and Google Slides. Sheets offers features like pivot tables, formulas, conditional formatting, and data validation for a variety of data-related tasks.\nGoogle Sheets is technically not an Excel-like spreadsheet (although general use and behaviour is similar to Excel) as it doesn’t use the ODF XML standard but rather has its own proprietary format called the Google Sheets format which can only be accessed or utilised through a web browser rather than through a standalone installer for your computer. In order to access/open a Google Sheets format outside of a browser, one h as to download it as either an Excel file or as a comma-separated value (CSV) file which can then be opened in Excel. Google Sheets has similar features and functionalities as Excel but because of its indirect compatibility with Excel and Excel-like ODF XML-compliant software, advanced features of both applications are not interoperable.",

    "text": "9.8 Databases\nA database is an organised collection of structured and/or unstructured data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. It’s a system for storing and managing data, and it’s managed by a Database Management System (DBMS). Databases are used to store, retrieve, and manipulate data efficiently.\nHence, the concept of a database is both software, which deals with the handling and management of the data, and hardware, which deals with the physical storage of the data.\n\n9.8.1 SQL and other relational databases\nSQL databases, also known as relational databases, are systems that store collections of tables and organise structured sets of data in a tabular columns-and-rows format, similar to that of a spreadsheet. The databases are built using structured query language (SQL), the query language that not only makes up all relational databases and relational database management systems (RDBMS), but also enables them to “talk to each other”.\nThe history of database technology/relational databases SQL was invented as a language in the early 1970s, which means SQL databases have been around for as long as the Internet itself. Dubbed the structured English query language (SEQUEL), SQL was originally created to streamline access to relational database systems and to assist with the processing of information. Today, SQL remains one of the most popular and widely used query languages in open-source database technology due to its flexibility, ease of use, and seamless integration with a variety of different programming languages. You’ll find SQL being used throughout all types of high-performing, data-centric applications.\n\n\n9.8.2 NoSQL\nNoSQL stands for “Not Only SQL.” It refers to a type of database that doesn’t rely on the traditional relational database models, which are organised into tables with fixed schemas and use SQL for querying. NoSQL databases offer a more flexible approach to data storage and querying, often using document, graph, key-value, or other data models. NoSQL databases are equipped to handle large volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from non-traditional sources.\nPopular database management systems include Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, SQLite, MariaDB, IBM Db2, Oracle Database, and MySQL. In essence, databases are fundamental to modern IT infrastructure, enabling organisations to store, manage, and analyse data efficiently for various applications, including websites, apps, and business processes.",

    "text": "9.12 Programming languages\nR, Python, and Julia are powerful programming languages frequently used in data science, scientific computing, and related fields. They offer distinct advantages, making them suitable for various tasks.\n\n9.12.1 R\nR is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.\nR provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and non-linear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, etc.) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.\nOne of R’s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control.\nR is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation’s GNU General Public License in source code form. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and MacOS.\nR is unique in that it is not general-purpose. It does not compromise by trying to do a lot of things. It does a few things very well, mainly statistical analysis and data visualisation. While you can find data analysis and machine learning libraries for languages like Python, R has many statistical functionalities built into its core. No third-party libraries are needed for much of the core data analysis you can do with the language.\nBut even with this specific use case, it is used in every industry you can think of because a modern business runs on data. Using past data, data scientists and data analysts can determine the health of a business and give business leaders actionable insights into the future of their company.\nJust because R is specifically used for statistical analysis and data visualisation doesn’t mean its use is limited. It’s actually quite popular, ranking 12th in the TIOBE index of the most popular programming languages.\nAcademics, scientists, and researchers use R to analyse the results of experiments. In addition, businesses of all sizes and in every industry use it to extract insights from the increasing amount of daily data they generate.\n\n\n9.12.2 Python\nPython is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows.\nPython is a high-level general-purpose programming language that can be applied to many different classes of problems.\nThe language comes with a large standard library that covers areas such as string processing (regular expressions, Unicode, calculating differences between files), internet protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, XML-RPC, POP, IMAP), software engineering (unit testing, logging, profiling, parsing Python code), and operating system interfaces (system calls, filesystems, TCP/IP sockets). Look at the table of contents for The Python Standard Library to get an idea of what’s available. A wide variety of third-party extensions are also available. Consult the Python Package Index to find packages of interest to you.\n\n\n9.12.3 Julia\nJulia is a high-level, open-source, general-purpose programming language designed for technical and scientific computing. It’s known for its fast performance, approaching that of languages like C and Fortran, while remaining relatively easy to use. Julia is particularly well-suited for tasks like numerical analysis, data science, and machine learning.",
