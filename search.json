    "section": "",
    "text": "Preface\nIn today’s data-driven world, the responsibility of public service demands more than experience and intuition; it requires evidence-based decision-making grounded in a deep understanding of data. For government officials at all levels, from local administrators to national policymakers, data is not just a tool - it is an indispensable asset in crafting policies that are effective, equitable, and accountable. Data for Decision Makers is developed with you in mind: to support those entrusted with public leadership in leveraging data to serve communities more effectively.\nAcross the domains of public health, education, transportation, environmental policy, and beyond, the availability of data has never been greater. But with this abundance comes complexity. Making sense of it - identifying relevant patterns, understanding root causes, evaluating outcomes, and anticipating future trends - requires more than access. It demands a strong foundation in the principles and practices of modern data use.\nThis course highlights how data literacy empowers government officials to navigate uncertainty, combat misinformation, and design policies that truly respond to the needs of the public. From statistical reasoning and geographic information systems to predictive modelling and real-time dashboards, the tools of data are transforming governance. Understanding these tools is essential to strengthening transparency, accountability, and public trust.\nThis course bridges the gap between technical expertise and policy leadership. It offers clear, accessible explanations of core data concepts alongside practical examples from the public sector. Whether your role involves strategic planning, budget allocation, programme evaluation, or legislative development, this course will help you make more informed, timely, and impactful decisions.\nPublic service is a profound responsibility. By embracing the potential of data, government leaders can enhance their ability to meet that responsibility with clarity, foresight, and integrity.",

    "text": "1.1 Data-driven decision-making\nIn an era defined by information, the ability to make sound decisions increasingly hinges on the intelligent use of data. Across sectors and industries, from healthcare and education to finance and public policy, decision-makers are confronted with unprecedented volumes of information. Yet, it is not the sheer quantity of data that holds value, but our capacity to interpret, understand, and apply it effectively.\nData is more than numbers on a spreadsheet; it is the language of modern insight. When approached with the right tools and understanding, it becomes a powerful asset for identifying patterns, predicting outcomes, evaluating strategies, and ultimately, improving results. For decision-makers, this means developing fluency not just in reading reports, but in questioning assumptions, validating sources, and interpreting results within context.\nUnderstanding modern data concepts - from statistical reasoning and data visualisation to machine learning and real-time analytics - is no longer optional. It is foundational. These concepts empower leaders to move beyond intuition and anecdote, and toward evidence-based action. As data continues to shape the world around us, the ability to engage with it critically and creatively is becoming an essential skill.\nThis course aims to equip its participants with both the conceptual grounding and practical knowledge to navigate this landscape. Whether you are a seasoned executive, a policy analyst, or an emerging leader, this course is designed to bridge the gap between data science and decision-making. It demystifies the tools and techniques of modern data analysis and offers real-world applications that demonstrate how data can drive progress and innovation.\nGood decisions are not just supported by data; they are shaped by those who know how to use it wisely.\nData-driven decision-making refers to the process of making decisions based on data and information rather than intuition or experience alone. It involves collecting, analysing, interpreting, and presenting data to support decision-making processes.\nIn this approach, decisions are made by relying on facts, figures, trends patterns, and insights derived from data. The goal is to make objective, evidence-based decisions that are more accurate, consistent, and transparent.\nData-driven decision-making often involves the use of tools, techniques, and technologies such as data analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and visualisation software. By leveraging these tools, organisations can transform raw data into actionable insights that drive better outcomes.",

It allows organisations and individuals to:\n\nInformed Decisions - make decisions based on data rather than assumptions or guesswork;\nImproved Accuracy - educe errors and biases by relying on objective information;\nEfficiency - Optimise resources and processes by identifying trends, patterns, and inefficiencies;\nTransparency - ensure that decisions are made in an open and transparent manner; and,\nScalability - Apply to large-scale operations or complex problems where traditional methods may be insufficient.",
